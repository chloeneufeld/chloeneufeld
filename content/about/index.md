I am a second year graduate student at Yale University, working with Prof. Pieter van Dokkum. My research interests are galaxy formation and evolution, with a focus on processes that disturb the baryon cycle (e.g., mergers and AGN feedback) and lead to quenching. In my latest work, I explore the star forming sequence at cosmic noon with data from the JWST FRESCO program, using NIR photometry to derive masses and Paschen-alpha emission lines to derive star formation rates. I have also been working on a project with Prof. Daisuke Nagai studying feedback implementation in CAMELS-SIMBA simulations and quantifying how feedback energetics differ between AGN and SN feedback in SIMBA and IllustrisTNG."

I earned my undergraduate degree in physics (with an emphasis in astrophysics) at UC Davis, along with minors in math and art history. I worked with Prof. Marusa Bradac, modeling gravitationally lensed high redshift galaxies and studying their sizes using HST RELICS data. While at UC Davis, I was an active member of the Physics Club and helped organize events for physics students and the public, and I also worked as a writing tutor and a Python programming tutor.
